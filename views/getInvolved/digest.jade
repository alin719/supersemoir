        p As the CEO of Crowdbooster, <strong> Ricky Yean </strong> wants everyone to understand how to get more out of social media. Ricky first began experimenting with Twitter in 2008 and quickly became fascinated by the potential for new relationships between us and the people and organizations that we love. Crowdbooster is funded by Y Combinator and prominent angel investors, and serves clients like Lil Wayne, JetBlue, LA Times, and Ben & Jerry’s. Before Crowdbooster, Ricky graduated with a BA in Science, Technology and Society from Stanford, where he served as BASES co-president.
